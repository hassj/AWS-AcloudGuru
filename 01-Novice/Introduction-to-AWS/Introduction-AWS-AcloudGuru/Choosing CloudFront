Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to Choosing CloudFront. In this lesson,
we are going to learn all about Amazon CloudFront,
Amazon's content delivery network. So let's get started.
Do you recall my lecture about Amazon ElastiCache?
It was a service you put between your website and your database to cache
database requests in-memory,
so you don't have to continually hit that database and read
information from the disk every time. CloudFront is like that,
but instead of between your website and your database,
it exists between your website and the people visiting your website,
and its purpose is to deliver data, videos, applications,
and websites to your customers globally with low latency and high
transfer speeds. How does it do that? Well,
if you recall how Amazon has regions around the world for you to run their
services in, they also have something called edge locations,
which refer to the locations around the world that they can serve your website.
from with CloudFront.
They use a global network of more than 225 points of presence,
in 88 cities, across 45 countries.
This means if you have a website hosted in US East 1,
so North Virginia in the USA,
and suddenly your website gets really popular in South Africa,
the users are going to have a lot of latency requesting website data so far
away. With CloudFront,
the internet traffic isn't going to have to travel halfway around the world and
back for all of these South African internet users to access your website.
CloudFront will be serving as much of your website as possible
from its edge locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
How does it do this? Well, anytime a client requests,
something from your website,
it actually accesses CloudFront first and CloudFront
automatically redirects the request of the file that you want to the nearest
edge location.
The files are then stored at the edge location in their cache for a period of
time that you specify.
If a visitor requests content that has been cached longer than the expiration
time specified, CloudFront checks the origin server,
that is your web server to see if a new version of the file is available.
If it is, it copies the new version over to the edge location.
So this means any changes you make to the files are replicated to edge locations
as your visitors request the content, and then the client receives the file.
It's a brilliant system and it's what keeps websites running fast,
no matter where in the world you may be requesting them from.
CloudFront also has additional features, security being a very large one.
If your website is suddenly available via a data center,
nowhere near your actual web server,
you are actually protected against multiple types of network and denial of
service attacks.
It's the CloudFront service which will be the target of these network attacks
instead of you,
and Amazon have the resources to deal with that a lot better than you probably
do. Your web server is also protected against sudden traffic spikes,
because again,
CloudFront is handling the large amount of requests that would normally be
hitting your web server.
They're simply cached and served from the edge locations instead.
CloudFront even has a feature called Lambda at Edge,
which gives you the ability to run your Lambda code at these edge locations,
instead of back in the region you normally operate in.
This reduces latency and improves performance massively keeping your
compute closer to the users requesting it.
CloudFront brings you lots of real-time metrics and logging too,
so you can see what's being requested, where from,
and how quickly. It's cost-effective,
it uses pay as you go pricing,
and you only pay for what you use with no minimum fees.
So speed up your website, secure your website,
protect your website, all with Amazon's content delivery network,
Amazon CloudFront. Thanks for watching. If you have any questions,
please let me know. Otherwise feel free to move on to the next lesson.
