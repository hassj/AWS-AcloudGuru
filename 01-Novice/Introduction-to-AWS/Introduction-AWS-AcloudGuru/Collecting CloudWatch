Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to Collecting CloudWatch. In this lesson,
we're going to learn all about Amazon CloudWatch. So let's get started.
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service for AWS.
It's built so you can see what's going on in your AWS account.
It lets you collect metrics or data from your services.
It currently integrates with about 70 AWS services.
So if you're a new organization wondering how to monitor everything happening in
your AWS account, CloudWatch, most likely has you covered.
There's loads of predefined metrics, which each service has,
and CloudWatch will automatically collect these for you.
Now it doesn't just collect,
it also displays this data for you in various graphs,
and it gives you a unified view of all of your AWS resources by these graphs.
And you can even set alarms based on the data in those graphs,
and you can trigger various things to occur based on those alarms too.
CloudWatch also allows you to send your log files to it,
so you have a centralized log store for your entire organization.
It also allows you to interactively search and analyze your log data too,
which can help you quickly and effectively respond to problems when they arise.
Let's look at an example of what you could do with CloudWatch and CloudWatch
logs.
Say you have a Linux EC2 instance and people use SSH to connect to it,
so port 22. The SSH port is open to the world,
but you want to know if anyone is attempting to hack into your servers via SSH.
What you can do is send your SSH login logs to CloudWatch logs.
You can use a filter on these logs to automatically detect failed logins and
graph them. Then you can create an alarm on that graph.
When the amount of filed logins over a five minute period is say a higher than
five. And when that's triggered you are notified. The
overall principle is simple. You get a metric into CloudWatch,
then you can graph the metric and take action on it should it reach a threshold.
This is infinitely expandable.
You can log anything you want to CloudWatch using something called a custom
metric. You can then graph that metric and be alerted on any threshold you set.
Want to know when your projected billing for the month is going to be over $0?
You can set an alarm for that to ensure that you stay within the AWS free tier
and don't spend more money that you want to. It's the power of CloudWatch,
a service that lets you watch over your AWS services,
observe what you need and gives you the actionable insights you need to monitor
your applications to make sure they never go offline. Thanks for watching.
