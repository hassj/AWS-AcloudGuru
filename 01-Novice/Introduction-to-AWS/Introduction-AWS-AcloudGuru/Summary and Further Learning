Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to the final lesson,
which is our summary and some suggestions for further learning.
Just as I went through at the start of the course,
I'd like to wrap up with a summary of what you have learned.
We began with our introduction and our overview lectures.
Then we got into the important topics. We covered security and identity,
compute services, storage services, databases, networking.
We had a chat about all the services to do with management and governance,
the fun of machine learning,
and just finished up last lecture with some simple architecture examples.
If you would like to continue your studies down the AWS path,
I highly recommend your next course be our AWS Certified Cloud
Practitioner course,
which is the first entry-level certification course available for AWS.
It's up to you if you want to sit the exam and actually earn the certification,
but the course itself is full of great content to get you started on your AWS
journey. And I'd just like to finish up with a huge thank you to you.
Thank you for watching all of my lessons.
Thank you for all of the feedback if you've given any.
If you haven't feel free to post on our forum at any time.
I put a lot of hard work into this course,
so I'd be happy to receive any feedback you have. All right, for the last time,
thank you for watching and we'll see you again soon.
